Current changes:
 * map/reduce operators
 * Sexy demo
   * shared canvas to put and arrow-link anything: text, pictures, ...
   * atomic objects are spatially connected to tiles to limit browsing
      * clients sync with tiles every couple of seconds
   * timeline

Most recent previous changes:
 * rlambda (closure can access to itself as "it")
 * anonymous arrow API (avoid it as long as you can!)
 * hook API. Root flag is used to prevent attack proof or invalidate a hook
 * not-blocking childrenOf version:
      * syntax: /let/enum/childReview+a
      * returns a new "dynamic" operator
          * returned operator carries a handler to the enumerator
      * apply the operator to perform next/get on the enumerator
      * /enum+ => 1st children, /enum+ 2d children, etc.
 * API now reentrant. Lock at every sensible access of space.c/mem.c
     * no more global lock in server.c
 * a way to sync commit between concurrent agents
     * xl_begin(), xl_over()/xl_commit()
     * see server.c & testshell.c for usage
 * lock on the persistent file to prevent concurrent clients.
     * avoid mess when running several entrelacsd, testshell or any other libentrelacs clients,
     * temporarly close-unlock file right after commit
     * when relocking, one checks if file mtime changed. If so, nuke RAM cache!
* Added: a digest operator.
* Some web clients refuse to escape '.' character in %2E.
   Radical solution: URI format has changed. Now '/tail+head'
* Public API hides implementation of atoms: blob, tag or btag
  * blob or tag according to data size
* when an application is bound as is, it takes precedence over the corresponding closure evaluation.
  * it's an attempt to merge intensive and extensive definitions, that is function and environment/object.
* operator, closure & paddock: auto escaped and somewhat typed litterals. paddock is for macro.
* xls_get now returns NIL (FFFFFF) when no arrow found
* NIL is a undefined arrow. Different from Eve (0)
* virtualized evaluation (root/get/set are confined in a nested hierarchy of contexts)
* resolve now use xls_get to get "global" variable value
* rooting a pair is not enough any more to make a global bound variable.
  * Use xls_set(EVE,slot,value) instead.
      * will do root((EVE->slot)->value) ; root(EVE->(slot->value)))
* looseStack dumped in reverse order
* new API to get and retrieve "uri" (no more xl_program)
* and much more ...

Future:
 * doxygen integration
 * HTTP push connector
   * use in the demo

In study:
 * a session is actually a continuation
 * a lazy arrow is when (tailOf arrow) or (headOf arrow) are bounds to closure/operator in environment 
 * xls_set: create less arrows (but also less indexation)
     * e.g set x in a.b.c.d.e would only root /a.b.c.d/e.x if depth = 2
 * when an operator is GC by forget() -if tail(a) == operator (space-level reserved keyword)-
                 then forget do call the operator with special *GC* atom
                     on *GC* argument, operator should test it's really a GC (global variable in_commit TODO)
                     and free anything
