locking point:

In progress:
* doxygen integration

To be done
* merge API of: blob, tag et btag
  * That is: if tag/btag > 128 chars, then blob
* Merge API: xl_program/programOf <==> from/to_fingerprint
* Leverage on arrows to find UA sessions

* What an URI will be? Merge fingerprint and future URI concepts.
* xl_childrenOfCB : implementent map/fold variations

* run a program in a virtualization stack
 * v(k, a) = // where k a stack and a an arrow
  *   isEve(k) ? a :
  *       isEntrelacs(a) ? arrow(tail(k), v(head(k), a)) :
  *           arrow(v(k, head(a)), v(k, tail(a)))
 * the virtualization stack won't be reflexive-able. Out of machine state.

In study:
* xls_root to create less arrows (but also less indexation)
  * e.g root x in a.b.c.d.e would only root /a.b.c.d/e.x if depth = 2

To take care of:
* call-backs has to be refreshen every time the server starts.
