The "Entrelacs project" aims to develop a revolutionary computing environment, the <a href='EntrelacsSystem.md'>Entrelacs System</a>, where the "arrow" supersedes the "bit" as the fundamentally smallest piece of information. By "arrow", one means an immutable and uniquely defined oriented link between two said "arrows".<br>
<br>
<i>Entrelacs</i>  proposes to represent Knowledge with redundancy-free structures uniquely built from <i>arrows</i>. This new <a href='ArrowParadigm.md'>paradigm</a> might be summed up by the credo: <i>everything is arrow</i>.  Please also consider reading this <a href='IntroductionToEntrelacs.md'>Introduction</a> to better understand the thought process behind Entrelacs.<br>

<i>Some arrows structure</i></p>

This manner of storing information within a computing system brings to Entrelacs <a href='EntrelacsProperties.md'>many new properties</a> which distinguish it from more classical systems.<br>
<br>
In the near future, the EntrelacsSystem could happily stands for a single replacement to most middlewares within a single computer: interpreters, data base managers, file systems, applicative frameworks, and such. It may even evolve as an autonomous operating system on top of dedicated hardware.<br>
<br>
For the moment, the current prototype is more simply designed as a network (HTTP based) software server on top of a GNU/Linux OS. For a better introduction of the project's technical aspects, see DesignIntroduction.<br>
