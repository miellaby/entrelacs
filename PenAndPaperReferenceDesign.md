# Pen And Paper Reference Design

## Experiment

You can experiment with the [Entrelacs Paradigm](ArrowParadigm.md) using only a sheet of paper and a pencil.

1. Pick a sample of information. Prefer intricate predicates like: "cows make milk"; "babies drink milk"; "cows drink water"; "drink is a verb"; "water boiling point is 100°C", etc.
2. Break the information into pieces to form a structure of pairs of atomic concepts. For example: (babies (drink milk)).
3. Represent atomic concepts on the paper using signs (words, numbers, or doodles). Be careful to represent each concept only once.
4. Draw arrows between paired signs, e.g., (drink → milk).
5. Draw arrows between paired arrows, e.g., (babies → (drink → milk)).
6. Repeat the previous steps until all arrows are drawn. Be careful not to mimic _writing_! Each arrow (e.g., drink → milk) must be drawn only once. A pencil drawing doesn't mimic an _Arrow Space_ if several arrows share the same ends.

## Observe

Once finished, you may enjoy your work by noticing that:

* Any value (e.g., _milk_) is connected to all the information it belongs to.
* The same applies to a relation (e.g., _drink → milk_).
* You can add new information without erasing or modifying anything already drawn! Specifically, you can consider an existing piece of information at a more abstract level. For example: (at → (sea → level)) → ((water → (boiling → point)) → 100°C).

## A Step Further

Replace signs with _entrelacs_, which are discrete closed structures of arrows like 'Ouroboros,' 'Yin-Yang,' 'Triketra,' etc. Now, your page contains only arrows, yet the drawing still represents information.

## What Did We Do?

Did we invent a new data structure? Not really. Instead, we drew a data structure in a radically different way than we're accustomed to, by following the [Entrelacs Paradigm](ArrowParadigm.md). We used pen and paper as a device to store _arrows_, prototyping an [Arrow Space](ArrowsSpace.md).

With some self-discipline, a human, a pen and a piece of paper can serve as a surprisingly effective _Arrow Space_. The [Entrelacs Manifesto](EntrelacsManifesto.md) claims that the physical storage media of a computer may be turned into an [Arrow Space](ArrowsSpace.md) as well by coding a whole new computing stack leveraging both disks and RAM.
