You can experiment with the arrow paradigm using only a sheet of paper and a pencil.

  1. Pick a sample of information. Prefer some intricate predicates like: "cows make milk" ; "babies drink milk" ; "cows drink water" ; "drink is a verb" ; "water boiling point is 100°C", etc.
  1. takes information to pieces so to get a structure of pairs of atomic concepts. For example: (babies (drink milk)).
  1. Put atomic concepts on the paper by using some signs (words, numbers or doodles). But be careful, represent each concept only once.
  1. Then draw arrows between paired signs, like (drink → milk)
  1. Then draw arrows between paired arrows, like (babies → (make → milk))
  1. repeat previous steps til all arrows are drawn. But be careful, don't do as with _Writing_! Every arrow (e.g. make → milk) must be drawn only once! A pencil drawing doesn't mimic an arrows space if several arrows share the same ends.

Once finished, you may enjoy your work by noticing that
  * Whatever a value (says _milk_), it is connected to all the information it belongs to.
  * It works the same with a relation (says _drink  →  milk_).
  * One can add new information without erasing or modifying anything already drawn! More specifically, one can consider an existing piece of information in a more abstract level. Says: (at → (sea → level))  → ((water → (boiling → point)) → 100°C)

Extra step: replace signs by _entrelacs_, that is discrete closed structures of arrows like 'orobouros', 'Yin-Yang', 'Triketra'... Now there's only arrows on your page and yet the drawing still represents information.

So what did we do? Did we invent a new data structure? Not really. We rather drew a data structure in a radically different way than we're accustomed to. We used a pen and a paper sheet as a device to store arrows, namely an [arrows space](ArrowsSpace.md).

With some self-discipline, a sheet of paper actually makes a quite good _arrow space_. In a computer system, one needs for an [arrows space](ArrowsSpace.md) software to leverage available hardware.
