#summary Entrelacs Prototype architecture.

Entrelacs might eventually become a real Operating System. But for the moment, the Entrelacs prototype stands as yet an other virtual machine on top of an existing software stack; typically a GNU/Linux system.

The current prototype includes these components:
  * The [ArrowsSpace Arrows Space]. 
  * The [EntrelacsAbstractMachine Entrelacs machine].
  * An [EntrelacsServer HTTP/REST server].
  * A web based terminal (for the end user)

There are two public interfaces which gives access to both the ArrowsSpace and the EntrelacsAbstractMachine.
  * The C API of the [EntrelacsLibrary entrelacs library]
  * The HTTP/REST network API of the [EntrelacsServer].

In addition, a future API should permit the addition of native code to the Entrelacs machine. This API might been comprehended by the Entrelacs System itself, so rooting a particular arrow including a binary executable as a Blob might assimilate this binary as a system extension.
