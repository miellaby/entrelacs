#summary Scratch Page. Work in progress.

= Introduction =
This a *scratch page* to store work in progress note and ideas.

= To Be Studied =

We study the possibility to:
  * move IN/OUT cells to stuff holes due to cells deletion.
  * ~~use the reference counter to reduce the search range of IN/OUT arrows. The reference counters may be duplicated (one for IN, one for OUT) on this purpose.~~
  * ~~combine a "lastOne" bit with various cell contents to limit open addressing search. This bit must be updated when adding or removing elements in a block.~~
