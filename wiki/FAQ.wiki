Question: Since an arrow can easily be modeled as a node with two edges, an arrow system is nothing else than a particular kind of graphs. Where is the novelty then?

Answer:

    Arrows structures may be -and have probably been- studied as a constrained subset of graphs.

    But this approach is likely going to miss the key specificity of the Entrelacs paradigm. Arrow constructs are primarily seen as a set of enumerable objects by themselves. The paradigm shift consists in directly handle each of these objects uniquely and individually.

    Concretely, an Entrelacs system constantly and incrementally maintains the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction Transitive Reduction]^W^ of the overall graph formed by stored arrows constructs.

    The good new is that this task can be actually trivial (reads O(1) complexity) by cautiously avoiding existing graph-oriented technologies.

Question: Any computer is equivalent to a Turing Machine whatever its inner engineering. So, what makes you claim that Entrelacs systems will be "clever" that current computer systems?

Answer:
    You failed into the "[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TuringTrap Turing Trap]".
