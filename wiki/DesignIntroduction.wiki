#summary The anticipated Entrelacs prototype publishes API to interact and extend an Entrelacs abstract machine on top of an "Arrows space".
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

Please find herein an overview of the EntrelacsSystem, which deals with _arrows_ in the way explained by the ArrowParadigm.

====arrows space====
The most strategical component of the system is the [ArrowsSpace Arrows Space]. It's a place where one stores arrows.

====primary abstract machine====
The system dynamics is powered by the EntrelacsAbstractMachine, a software machine somehow similar to functional abstract machines modeled by programming language theory.

====primary language====
This top-level evaluation context interprets programs made out of arrows and "written" in the EntrelacsLanguage.

====First prototype====

The anticipated prototype will stand as a software server on top of a GNU/Linux platform. A COMET/REST protocol will allow network agents to interact with it. A C API will allow to program system extensions. See the EntrelacsPrototypeArchitecture for details.
