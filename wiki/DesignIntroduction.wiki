====Arrows space====
A major component of such a system is the [ArrowsSpace Arrows Space].

It's simply a device to store arrows.

====Primary machine and language====
The system also provides a default evaluation machine, namely the [EntrelacsAbstractMachine Entrelacs abstract machine], which evaluates programs made in the [EntrelacsLanguage Entrelacs Language]. Naturally, both programs and machine states are made out of arrows.

====System boundaries====

The currently developed prototype stands as a [EntrelacsServer software server] on top of a GNU/Linux hosting system.

This server publishes A COMET/REST API for networked interaction. A C API is also planed to allow native code execution within the system. See the EntrelacsPrototypeArchitecture for details.
