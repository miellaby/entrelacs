===Introduction===
Please find herein an overview of the EntrelacsSystem.

===arrow paradigm===
The system deals with "arrows". It's the ArrowParadigm.

===arrows space===
Arrows defined within the system are stored in the [ArrowsSpace Arrows Space].

===primary abstract machine===

The system behavior is computed by the EntrelacsAbstractMachine. It's a top-level machine somehow similar to an functional language abstract machine.

===primary language===
The top-level evaluation context interprets the EntrelacsLanguage.

===REST and C API===

The anticipated Entrelacs Prototype stands as a software server on top of a GNU/Linux platform.

A COMET/REST protocol allows applicative agents to interact with the system as arrows "publishers" and "subscribers".

The EntrelacsPrototypeArchitecture offers a C API allowing system extensions to bind actions to special arrow schemes.
