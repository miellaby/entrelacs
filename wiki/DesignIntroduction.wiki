#summary The anticipated Entrelacs prototype publishes API to interact and extend an Entrelacs abstract machine on top of an "Arrows space".
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

Please find herein an overview of the EntrelacsSystem, which deals with _arrows_ in the way explained by the ArrowParadigm.

===arrows space===
The most strategical component of the EntrelacsSystem is the [ArrowsSpace Arrows Space]. It's a place where one stores arrows.

===primary abstract machine===

The system dynamics is powered by the EntrelacsAbstractMachine, a software machine somehow similar to functional abstract machines from programming language theory.

===primary language===
This top-level evaluation context interprets programs made out of arrows and "written" in the EntrelacsLanguage.

===the prototype===

The anticipated Entrelacs Prototype will stand as a software server on top of a GNU/Linux platform. A COMET/REST protocol will allow network agents to connect. A C API will allow system extensions programming. See the EntrelacsPrototypeArchitecture for details.

Bad luck. That's all for the moment. Try "Work InProgress" page too.
