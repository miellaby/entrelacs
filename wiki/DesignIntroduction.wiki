=arrow paradigm=

Reminder: The Entrelacs System deals with "arrows". It's the ArrowParadigm.

=arrows space=

The EntrelacsSystem provides an orthogonally persistent support of arrows storage, namely the [ArrowsSpace Arrows Space].

=primary abstract machine & primary language=

The EntrelacsSystem includes a top-level abstract machine somehow similar to an abstract Lisp machine adapted to the ArrowParadigm. This EntrelacsAbstractMachine interprets a primary language: the EntrelacsLanguage.

=REST and C API of the Entrelacs prototype==

The Entrelacs Prototype stands as a client/server software on top of a GNU/Linux platform.

A COMET/REST protocol allows applicative agents to interact with the Entrelacs System as arrows "publishers" and "subscribers".

The EntrelacsPrototypeArchitecture offers a C API which allows system extensions to bind actions to special arrow schemes.
