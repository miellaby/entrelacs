#summary The anticipated Entrelacs prototype publishes API to interact and extend an Entrelacs abstract machine on top of an "Arrows space".
#labels Featured,Phase-Design

===Introduction===
Please find herein an overview of the EntrelacsSystem.

===arrow paradigm===
The system deals with "arrows". It's the ArrowParadigm.

===arrows space===
Arrows defined within the system are stored in the [ArrowsSpace Arrows Space].

===primary abstract machine===

The system behavior is computed by the EntrelacsAbstractMachine. It's a top-level machine somehow similar to an functional language abstract machine.

===primary language===
The top-level evaluation context interprets the EntrelacsLanguage.

===about the anticipated prototype===

The anticipated Entrelacs Prototype will stand as a software server on top of a GNU/Linux platform. A COMET/REST protocol will allow network agents to connect. A C API will allow system extensions. See the EntrelacsPrototypeArchitecture for details.
