#summary Entrelacs Systems may also be called Relative Machines

The key disruption brought by _Entrelacs System_ in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics cybernetics (w)] consists in how the system can now handle information _relativity_ with no limitation.

When information is modeled according to the [ArrowParagim Entrelacs Paradigm], some fact, rule, relationship, piece of knowledge, ... consists eventually in an _arrow_ than one may attach -with an other arrow- to an existing structure of arrows.  In other words, any piece of information may be comprehended as a statement in a higher level [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) ontology (w)], whatever its initial domain, its complexity, or its own level of abstraction.

An _Entrelacs System_ is an information system designed to store information as arrows. Consequently, no statement is definitively absolute within such a system. Quite the contrary, every statement may be declared relatively to a referential. And the relationship between this statement and this referential can be in turn _abstracted_, that is comprehended as a statement that one may attaches to a higher level referential. And the resulting meta-relationship (which is still an arrow) can be in turn stated relatively to a meta-meta-referential, and so on.
