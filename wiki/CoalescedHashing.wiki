#summary Coalesced hashing

This enhancement to OpenAddressing consists in linking data cells within the ArrowsSpace.

The link is not a full address to any cell within the space.

It's only an offset factor which allows to jump over freed or unrelated cells within an open  block filled up with successive pieces of a coherent chain of data.

This offset factor only needs for a few bits within a storage cell.
