#summary The Entrelacs Abstract Machine

= Introduction =

The second major component of an Entrelacs System beside the ArrowsSpace is the _Entrelacs Abstract Machine_. It's a software machine which evals programs directly stored as arrows constructs.

Programs are defined according to the [EntrelacsLanguage Entrelacs Language] (EL). This language is designed so that there is no difference between, source code, CST (Concrete Syntax Tree), and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The objective is to simplify meta-programming and persistent reflexivity.

The machine state itself consists in an arrow construct which may be read and modified by the running program. A programs may consequently handle all the underlying machine state components like:
  * environments,
  * continuations,
  * closures,
  * evaluated expression
  * etc.

It obviously implies that *the machine state itself takes part of the language definition*.

== Sources and credits ==
The _Entrelacs Machine_ described hereafter is largely inspired by the 
[http://users.info.unicaen.fr/~karczma/TEACH/Doc/compi_cont.pdf "_CaEK_" abstract machine of Flanagan et al. (1993)].

So the EL language is roughly equivalent to the "Core Scheme in A-normal form" language introduced in this paper (aka _A(CS)_).

In short, it's a very basic (not typed) functional language. The only thing to keep in mind is that programs and machine states are directly hold by arrows structures.

Textual source code is reserved for communication purpose. The current prototype should be able to assimilate arrow in the form of s-expression or URI (see [EntrelacsServer] API).

== Extensions to the very strict A(CS)_ language==

The EL language brings modifications to the _A(CS)_ language. They are tagged with #e# hereafter.

These extensions include:
   * The possibility to eval few CS expression which are not in A-normal form -like (t s) expressions-. They are handled by rewriting them on the fly into their A-normal equivalent.
   * Arrow casting and escaping. Any arrow may be seen as a variable symbol, or an expression, or a literal.
   * Unbound variables are left as is. Evaluating "hello" returns "hello" if not a bound variable.
   * Application on something other than a closure is left as is. ("hello" "world") returns ("hello" "world") if "hello" is not bound to a closure and "world" not bound.
   * the "@M" keyword is bound to the current machine state
   * a run keyword allows to replace the current machine state

== Restrictions ==

Functions are one-variable only.

= The Language =
{{{
x ::= any entrelacs arrow (Eve, tags, blobs)
a ::= x | (a a) // any arrow

// literals
v ::=  x // entrelacs are resolved if bound, otherwise left as is

=== Differences with actual code ===

Last update: 02/2012

The actual machine also features
 * (eval p)
    * It stacks an "eval" continuation so that:
    * the machine evaluates the "eval parameter" as en EL expression.
    * the machine then evaluates the result as an EL program. 
    * p=(let ((x (eval ss) s))
       * ==> M=(ss (e (eval ((x (s e)) k))))
    * p=(s (eval ss))
       * ==> M=(ss (e (eval ((p ((s (var p)) e)) k))))
 * Few language extensions are rewritten with "eval"
    * p == (let ((x v:(let ...)) s))
       * ==> pp=(let ((x (eval (escape v))) s))
    * p == (s v)
       * ==> pp=(s (eval (escape v))) if v a let expression 
 * (let ((Eve binding) exp)) directly puts _binding_ into environment
 * p=(load (s0 s1)) <==> p=(let ((Eve s0) s1)))
 * p == (let ((x (v0 v1)) s)) ==> pp = (let ((p v0) (let ((x ((var p) v1)) s))))
 * a lambdax construct.
   * defines special closure : C == ("lambdax" CC) with CC a regular closure
  *  special closure application parameter is not evaluated.
  * Allows to make "let" like construct.
  * TODO: convergence lambdax/system-cc
