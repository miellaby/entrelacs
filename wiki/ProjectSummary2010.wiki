The "Entrelacs project" aims to develop a revolutionary computing environment, the [EntrelacsSystem Entrelacs System], where the "arrow" supersedes the "bit" as the fundamentally smallest piece of information. By "arrow", one means an immutable and uniquely defined oriented link between two said "arrows".

_Entrelacs_  proposes to represent Knowledge with redundancy-free structures uniquely built from _arrows_. This new [ArrowParadigm paradigm] might be summed up by the credo: _everything is arrow_.  Please also consider reading this [IntroductionToEntrelacs Introduction] to better understand the thought process behind Entrelacs.

<i>Some arrows structure</i></p>

This manner of storing information within a computing system brings to Entrelacs [EntrelacsProperties many new properties] which distinguish it from more classical systems.

In the near future, the EntrelacsSystem could happily stands for a single replacement to most middlewares within a single computer: interpreters, data base managers, file systems, applicative frameworks, and such. It may even evolve as an autonomous operating system on top of dedicated hardware.

For the moment, the current prototype is more simply designed as a network (HTTP based) software server on top of a GNU/Linux OS. For a better introduction of the project's technical aspects, see DesignIntroduction.
