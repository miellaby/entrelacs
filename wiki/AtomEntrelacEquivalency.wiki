Atoms to Entrelacs equivalency page

= Introduction =

This page explains how atoms (binary sequences) can be handled by the system without breaking the "everything is an arrow" paradigm.

= Details =

According to _Entrelacs_ system, "everything is an arrow". In other means, any piece of information can be expressed in the form of _entrelacs_, that is closed and connected sets of arrows linked to each others. Entrelacs don't relay on "nodes" to be built. There is only one building block: *arrows*.

However, one may define //entrelacs// which are so interlaced it's impossible to find smaller closed graphs in them.  Such a non-decomposable entrelacs is called a "prim entrelacs".

== What a "prim entrelacs" looks like ? ==

Please look at these few signs on Wikipedia:
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taijitu
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triquetra

Entrelacs theory helping us to understand why these ancestral signs look so much important. It gives them a new meaning: they are "Prim Entrelacs".

==Prim entrelacs are atoms==

A "prim entrelacs" doesn't contain any smaller entrelacs. That's why we can say a "prim entrelacs" is equivalent to an atom. it is full-defined and can't be divided.

And even more important: it's possible to identify each "prim entrelacs". For example, the arrow whose both ends links to itself is usually named "Ouroboros". Next time you'll see it, you'll be able to put a name on it. Considering two drawings of "Ouroboros", we may say that the second drawing is "isomorphic" to the first one.

Consequently, even in a pure space of relations, it's possible to build prim entrelacs and use them as the symbols of a dictionnary.

==Scalars are prim entrelacs==
Moreover, by defining a bijection between the corresponding sets, one can even postulate that any binary sequence is equivalent to a particular "prim entrelacs". We may say the binary sequence is a condensed form of its corresponding entrelacs.

The conclusion is that using natively such binary sequences doesn't deny the fundamentals of Entrelacs.
