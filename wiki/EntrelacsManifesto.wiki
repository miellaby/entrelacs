= Introduction =
The *Entrelacs manifesto* claims one *can* and one *should* invent a computer system based upon an alternate information paradigm.

Anyone interested in this objective can freely adhere to this manifesto and relate his work to the Entrelacs umbrella project.

===Preamble to the Entrelacs manifesto===

Applied computer sciences help improving data structures.

However, no study has yet put into question the fundamental _paradigm_ which governs how such data structures are mapped onto concrete storage space.

Consequently, *all* digital and non-digital systems up to now follow a single paradigm, derived from _Writing_. As a side effect, all these systems are more of less modeled after _graph theory_.

Because the [BoxValueParadigm box/value paradigm], as we'll call it, is the only paradigm an human being is accustomed to, neither scientists nor engineers have though of an alternative.

=The Entrelacs manifesto=
==We claim that developing computer systems after the _box/value paradigm_ is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_inversion abstraction inversion]^W^ which makes software engineering excessively difficult.==

[BoxValueParadigm more ...]

==We claim that one may correct this inversion by promoting the *immutable* *connected* *ordered* *pair* *singleton* -that one refers herein as *an arrow*- to *first* and *only* citizen class of the whole information system. All former concepts, like _vertex_ and _values_, should be seen as derivative constructs made out of _arrows_. This approach is called the *Entrelacs paradigm*.==

[ArrowParadigm more ...]

==We claim that designing a computer system after this paradigm is feasible. We put the stress on the fact that one may simulate such a system with paper and pencil.==

[PenAndPaperReferenceDesign more ...]

==We believe that a working prototype can be designed out of existing hardware by developing an adequate software layer.==

[ArrowsSpace more ...] 

==We call for the immediate development of such an *Entrelacs system* because we believe it will lead the way to various new computer abilities.==
