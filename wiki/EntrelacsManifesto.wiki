===Preamble===

Applied computer sciences help improving data structures.

However, no study has yet put into question the fundamental _paradigm_ which governs how such data structures are mapped onto concrete storage space.

Consequently, *all* digital and non-digital systems up to now follow a single paradigm, derived from _Writing_. As a side effect, all these systems are more or less modeled after _graph theory_.

Because the [BoxValueParadigm box/value paradigm], as we'll call it here, is the only paradigm an human being is accustomed to, neither scientists nor engineers have deeply explore a true alternative.

=The Entrelacs manifesto=

The *Entrelacs manifesto* claims one *can* and one *should* design a computer system based upon an alternate information paradigm.

Anyone interested in this objective can freely adhere and relate his work to this manifesto.

More specifically, the *manifesto* makes the following claims:

<ol>
 <li><strong>The current paradigm in use regarding information storage within computers is an _abstraction inversion_ <sup>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_inversion wiki def]</sup></strong>
     <p> [BoxValueParadigm Read more about the box/value paradigm ...]
 <li><strong>Fixing this abstraction inversion leads to the _Entrelacs Paradigm_</strong>
    <p> It consists in promoting *arrows* to be the *first* and *only* citizen class of the whole information system.
    <p> Arrows are *recursively* defined as *singletons of immutable connected ordered pair of arrows*.
    <p> In this paradigm, old concepts, like _vertex_ or _values_, are considered as various constructs made out of _arrows_.
    <p> [ArrowParadigm Read more about the Entrelacs paradigm ...]
 <li><strong>An information storage system designed after the _Entrelacs paradigm_ is feasible</strong>
    <p>as demonstrated by a simple experiment with paper and pencil.
    <p>[PenAndPaperReferenceDesign Read more about the "pen & paper" reference design ...]
 <li><strong>Coding a <u>software implementation</u> of such a storage system is possible</strong>
    <p>with reasonable performances on existing hardware plateforms. 
    <p>[ArrowsSpace Read more about arrow spaces ...]
 <li><strong>Computing environments on top of _arrows spaces_ will feature a whole new range of native abilities.</strong>
   <p>[EntrelacsCapabilities Read more about native abilities of "Entrelacs Systems"...]
