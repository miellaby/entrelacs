== intensional definition of a function with arrows ==

The straightforward way to store knowledge with arrows consists in rooting referrer to referee mapping links. A set of rooted arrows intensionally defines a function &#131;: referrer &rarr; referee

== contextualizing information ==

But the fundamental key to arrows usage is to define _contexts_ as sets of arrows pointed by context arrows. Contexts can embeds inner contexts, forming a context hierarchy.
