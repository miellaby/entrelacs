#summary Overview of knowledge representation strategy with "arrows" structures

= Low principles =
== intensional definition ==

A straightforward way to store knowledge with arrows consists in intensionally defining a function from referrer to referee with links like:
{{{
  (color,red)
  (age,150)
  (height,3m)
}}}

== contextualizing information ==

Directly rooting statements would mix unrelated information in the same top-level context. It's better rooting arrows which refers such statement arrows by a context entity.

For example:
{{{
   (Bob,(age,20))
}}}

Those contextualizing arrows can be contextualized in outer contexts, as well. This abstraction process can be repeated as much as necessary, to form a context meta-hierarchy.
{{{
   (Jane,(Belief,(Bob,(age,20))))
}}}

The entity used as a context depends on the paradigm in use. Here is an overview of the possible choices of context.

= Overview =

== Object Oriented ==
The context is the object that one knows information about. One roots arrows between the object context and property to value arrows.

== Functional Oriented ==
The context is a function that gathers all known statements about the value of this function when applied to various objects. One roots arrows between the function object (typically a property) and object to value arrows.

== Neuronal network ==

In short, there is no particular context. Different kinds of statements arrows are rooted in the top-level context whatever they corresponds  property->value, objet->value or value->value relations.

Retrieving stored information consists in propagating activation states from several input entities. The most activated arrow forms the network's response.

=== Warning ===

Neuron oriented model could be the most efficient knowledge representation strategy in terms of storage usage. But the resulting graph could also become ambiguous when non-orthogonal statements are mixed together.

== Tagsonomy ==

Tagsonomy structures works in the same way as neuronal networks. It implies they have the same strength and weakness.

== Meta tagsonomy / unambiguous neuronal model == 

Ambiguity can be removed from tagsonomy by tagging tag-to-tagged relationship. For example
{{{
   anti->(socialism->http://capitalism.org)
}}}
