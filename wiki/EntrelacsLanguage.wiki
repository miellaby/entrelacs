#summary The EntrelacsLanguage (EL) is a language specially designed for the Entrelacs System.

= Introduction =

In difference with any existing language, an EL source is directly made from the material the evaluator operates! Indeed, when stored into a working Entrelacs System, an EL source is made of arrows (from the ArrowParadigm) brought by the ArrowsSpace. This is definitely not a text file, which is only a importation/exportation format).

EL is a single class citizenship based language as Combinatory Logic Theorical Language is. There is no separation between variable/symbol vs. literals/scalars. This audacious choice makes easier to design a computation cache (Memoization). It leads to an interesting universally applicable strategy of optimization, as most often used code patterns will hit the computation cache for ready-to-use _continuations_.
