Actively rewritten. Draft [EntrelacsLanguageDraft here].

The [EntrelacsLanguage Entrelacs language] (EL) is a programing language designed to evaluate expressions in the form of arrow constructs within an [ArrowsSpace arrows space].

To get the best benefits from this particular environment, EL source code looks like the continuation passing style (CPS) Abstract Syntax Tree of a translated functional language program.

This makes EL goes a step further than traditional _homoiconicity_. An EL program can:

 * access itself at source level,
 * modify itself and other programs at source level,
 * make these changes persistent.

In short, EL is fully reflexive. An EL based program gets:
 * the ability to access itself, aka _introspection_
 * the ability to modify itself, aka _intercession_

It makes an _Entrelacs system_ an ideal platform for reflexive computing.
