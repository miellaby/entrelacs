Done:

* Problem: Some web clients refuse to escape '.' character in %2E.
   Radical solution: URI format has changed. Now '/tail+head'
* merged API of: blob, tag et btag
  * if size > 100 then blob else tag
* operator, closure & paddock: now auto escaped, as typed litteral
* xls_get now returns NIL (FFFFFF) when no arrow found
  * NIL is a undefined arrow. Different from Eve (0)
* virtualized evaluation (root/get/set are confined in a nested hierarchy of contexts)
* resolve now use xls_get to get "global" variable value
* now rooting a pair won't make a global bound variable. Use xls_set(EVE,slot,value) instead.
  ===> root((EVE->slot)->value) ; root(EVE->(slot->value)))
* xlg_get bug fix. Recursive get up to the root context might fail.
* beware space.c show_cell return;
* looseStack dumped in reverse order
* new API to get and retrieve "uri" (no more xl_program)

In progress:
* doxygen integration

To be done:
 * locking point: Eval based recursion is terrible.
 * xl_childrenOfCB : implementent map/fold variations
 * xls_set: create less arrows (but also less indexation)

To fix latter:
 * refresh all callback every time the server starts (because recompilation).

In study:
 * e.g set x in a.b.c.d.e would only root /a.b.c.d/e.x if depth = 2
 * a session is actually a continuation
