### Preamble ###

Despite devising data structures, Computer Sciences have not yet put into question the fundamental _paradigm_ which governs how data structures are mapped onto concrete
storage spaces.

Consequently, **all** digital and analogical systems ever designed represent knowledge in the same way, a way derived from _Writing_, as we humans are accustomed to.

# The Entrelacs manifesto #

The **Entrelacs manifesto** claims one **can** and one **should** develops computing systems
based on a new information paradigm called the _Entrelacs Paradigm_.

Anyone interested in this objective can freely adhere and relate their work to this manifesto.

More specifically, this manifesto makes the following claims:

1. **The only paradigm in use so far to store information within computers is the [box/value paradigm](BoxValueParadigm.md). Unfortunately, it's a fundamental _[abstraction inversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_inversion)_** which hinders computer abilities.

2. **The _Entrelacs Paradigm_ is a better abstraction for information representation**  
   It consists in promoting **arrows** as the **first** and **only** citizen class of an information system.  
   An arrow is **recursively** defined as an **abstract-made-concrete immutable content-indexed singleton of a pair of arrows**.
   In this paradigm, all data structures are reimagined as _arrows_, up to fundamental information units like _vertex_ and _values_.

3. **It's possible to design an entirely new knowledge system designed after the _Entrelacs paradigm_**  
   as demonstrated by a simple ["pen & paper" experiment](PenAndPaperReferenceDesign.md).

4. **It's possible to code a reasonably efficient _software implementation_ of such a knowledge system, known as an _[Arrow Space](ArrowsSpace.md)_** on top of existing hardware platforms.

5. **It's necessary to develop a new form of Computing Environment based on an _Arrow Space_, namely an _Entrelac System_,** which will demonstrate a whole new range of **[native abilities](EntrelacsCapabilities.md).**
